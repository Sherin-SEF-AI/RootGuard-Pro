# Security Guide - Rootkit Detection Tool

## Purpose and Scope

This application is designed exclusively for **defensive security analysis** to help system administrators and security professionals detect potential rootkit infections and hidden malware on Windows systems.

## Legitimate Use Cases

âœ… **Approved Uses:**
- System administration and security auditing
- Incident response and forensic analysis
- Educational purposes and security research
- Compliance auditing and monitoring
- Threat hunting and malware detection

## Security Features

### Detection Capabilities
- **Multi-method Process Enumeration**: Uses multiple Windows APIs to detect process hiding techniques
- **Service Analysis**: Compares SCM and registry data to find discrepancies
- **Network Monitoring**: Identifies hidden network connections and suspicious traffic
- **Hook Detection**: Analyzes system call hooks and API modifications
- **Baseline Comparison**: Tracks system changes over time

### Data Protection
- **Secure Logging**: Tamper-resistant logs with integrity checksums
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally in encrypted SQLite database
- **No External Communication**: Tool operates entirely offline (except optional IP lookups)
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all analysis activities

### Safety Measures
- **Administrator Validation**: Requires elevated privileges for proper system access
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: All potentially dangerous operations require user confirmation
- **Read-Only Analysis**: Primary focus on detection, not system modification
- **Whitelist Support**: Allows exclusion of known legitimate processes and services

## Usage Guidelines

### Before Running Analysis
1. **Backup Critical Data**: Although the tool is read-only, always backup important data
2. **Close Unnecessary Applications**: Reduces false positives and improves accuracy
3. **Update Definitions**: Ensure antivirus is current before analysis
4. **Document Baseline**: Create system baseline during clean state

### Interpreting Results
- **Hidden Items**: May indicate rootkit presence but could be legitimate (drivers, security software)
- **Suspicious Items**: Require further investigation but may be false positives
- **Process Discrepancies**: Normal for some system processes and security software
- **Network Connections**: External connections should be verified against known applications

### Best Practices
1. **Regular Scanning**: Schedule periodic scans to establish patterns
2. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare results against known clean system state
3. **Cross-Reference**: Verify findings with other security tools
4. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of all findings and actions
5. **Professional Consultation**: Consult security professionals for complex infections

## Privacy and Ethics

### Data Handling
- All scan data remains on local system
- No telemetry or external data transmission
- User controls all data retention and disposal
- Reports can be sanitized before sharing

### Responsible Disclosure
- Report security vulnerabilities responsibly
- Do not use findings to compromise other systems
- Respect privacy and confidentiality requirements
- Follow applicable laws and regulations

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- **Kernel-level Rootkits**: Advanced rootkits may evade detection
- **Zero-day Threats**: Unknown malware may not be detected
- **Performance Impact**: Deep scans may temporarily slow system
- **False Positives**: Legitimate software may trigger alerts

### Platform Limitations
- **Windows Only**: Designed specifically for Windows systems
- **Administrator Required**: Cannot function without elevated privileges
- **Antivirus Interference**: May conflict with some security software

## Incident Response

### If Threats Are Detected
1. **Do Not Panic**: Carefully analyze findings before taking action
2. **Isolate System**: Disconnect from network if confirmed infection
3. **Document Evidence**: Export all scan results and logs
4. **Professional Help**: Contact security professionals for serious infections
5. **Clean Removal**: Use appropriate malware removal tools
6. **System Rebuild**: Consider complete system rebuild for severe infections

### False Positive Handling
1. **Verify Legitimacy**: Research suspicious processes and services
2. **Check Digital Signatures**: Legitimate software should be signed
3. **Update Whitelist**: Add confirmed legitimate items to whitelist
4. **Report Issues**: Submit false positive reports to improve detection

## Legal Compliance

### Authorized Use Only
- Only use on systems you own or have explicit permission to analyze
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Respect corporate policies and procedures
- Maintain appropriate documentation and audit trails

### Data Protection
- Follow GDPR, HIPAA, and other applicable privacy regulations
- Secure all scan data and reports appropriately
- Implement data retention and disposal policies
- Control access to sensitive analysis results

## Support and Updates

### Getting Help
- Review documentation and troubleshooting guide
- Check system requirements and permissions
- Verify configuration settings
- Test on known clean systems first

### Reporting Issues
- Provide detailed system information
- Include relevant log files and error messages
- Describe steps to reproduce issues
- Specify expected vs. actual behavior
